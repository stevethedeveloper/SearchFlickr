# Overview 
- UIKit
- Autolayout programmatically
- MVVM
- Decodable with CodingKeys and keyDecodingStrategy
- Text field and collection view delegates

# Extra Credit / Other
- Using a custom text field with a completion handler, using a timer for better user experience.  The delegate technique wasn't searching on each keystroke.  I left both versions in the code, but commented out the delegate method.  I can demonstrate either.
- Supports landscape and portrait
- Supports light/dark mode
- Dynamic text
- Uses SDWebImage for downloading images in collection view, with caching

# There's a lot of ways to improve this, and I'd be happy to discuss them.  Some examples include things in the extra credit list, such as Accessibility, showing the metadata, sharing, and things not on the list like styling.
